# Exon-skipping-in-Spiromics
 - This repository was created to save and track the scripts, files and notes for Annie's project to measure Exon skipping events in IL6R and Fas genes
in Spiromics data
- Similar Isoform analysis was done by Steph with ACE2 region(differential use of the first exon of ACE2 (There were three subtypes Exon 1a, 1b, and 1c))
- using the code from Steph and tweaking it as needed
